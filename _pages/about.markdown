I am a Final Year Ph.D. Student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/){:target="_blank"} Department at [University of California Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I am advised by Professor [Vagelis Papalexakis](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~epapalex/){:target="_blank"}. My primary research interest is in Multi-Aspect Data Mining specifically around streaming tensor decomposition algorithms and time-evolving graphs.

Prior to this, I worked in industry and have a work experience of close to three years, where I mainly worked as a DevOps engineer and spent the majority of my time involved in writing Infrastructure as a code, automation for deployments, creating/evaluating new tools which provide visibility into the system.

Apart from work, I enjoy cooking, reading, and traveling. I also ride motorcycles and have done (almost) two cross-country trips(from California to East Tennessee and back). Follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/that.beard.guy/){:target="_blank"} for my riding adventures.
